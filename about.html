                        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
                        <p>Hilltop Square opened its doors in 2007 as the first community shopping centre in Hillcrest, providing a one-stop shopping solution to help Hilltopians avoid the long trek into the city. We quickly became part of the community and are now an easily accessible, easy-to-navigate centre that provides Hilltop residents with all the relevant necessities of everyday life and epitomises the essence of convenience.
                             <br>
                        It is part of the outer west suburbs of Durban.Hilltop was formerly a sleepy village, governed by its own Town Board on the outskirts of Durban that has now become a booming suburb incorporated into the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality. Hill Top (as the town's name was variously spelt until 1969) was founded on a rise in the main road from Durban to Pietermaritzburg in 1895 as a farming or "weekend" village, then a good distance from what was the emerging port of Port Natal.
                              <br>
                        The village was laid out as leasehold sites on a portion of the farm Albinia owned by William Gillitt, one of the main pioneer families of the area and after which the nearby suburb of Gillitts is named.One of the other early families to set up in the area was the Acutts who had already established the well known in Durban estate agents firm of that name. In 1903 the first school in the village was established in a wood and iron cottage in Hospital Road leased to a Mrs McMillian, the principal of the first Highbury School, by Horace Acutt.
                            <br>
                        When the first Hilltop Health Committee was established in 1943, the total all-race population was 1135 persons and only the Main Road was hardened. Nkutu Road was hardened with klinker in 1947 and this was followed in 1951 with the hardening of the first portion of Inanda Road.
                             <br>
                        In 1962 blacktopping of selected roads in the central area began, followed by further roads in 1965. By 1971, when Town Board status was obtained, the total population had grown to 2799 persons.
