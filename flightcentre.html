                        <h3>FLIGHT CENTRE</h3>
                         <br>

                            Flight Centre is the domestic arm of the Flight Centre Travel Group and the  largest retailer of travel in Australia. Headquartered on Grey Street in South Bank Brisbane, its portfolio including niche brands features 1,300 businesses across Australia, with the company posting before-tax profits of $349.2 million in June 2013.

                            Founded by Graham "Skroo" Turner in 1981 following the success of his Topdeck Travel company, the first Flight Centre store opened in Sydney in 1982. Melbourne and Brisbane stores were soon added and by 1988 there were more than 50 Flight Centre shopfronts across Australia.Following rapid growth, Flight Centre Limited listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in December 1995 for 95 cents per share, with stocks subsequently trading at $26.65 as of 6 March 2020.

                            <br>
                            Turner stepped aside as chief executive in 2002, but resumed the role from Shane Flynn in 2005 in the wake of diminishing profits and share dividends.[2] Share prices dropped to an historic low of less than $5 in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-08, but rallied in the wake of the company's aggressive push into Asian and American markets.
