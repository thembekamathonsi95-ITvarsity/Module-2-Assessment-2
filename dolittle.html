                            BRIEF SYNOPSIS:
                                 <BR>
                            After losing his wife seven years earlier, the eccentric Dr. John Dolittle (Downey), famed doctor and veterinarian of Queen Victoriaâ€™s England, hermits himself away behind the high walls of Dolittle Manor with only his menagerie of exotic animals for company. But when the young queen (Jessie Buckley) falls gravely ill, a reluctant Dolittle is forced to set sail on an epic adventure to a mythical island in search of a cure, regaining his wit and courage as he crosses old adversaries and discovers wondrous creatures. Dolittle, in full known as The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle, is directed by American screenwriter / filmmaker Stephen Gaghan, director of the films Abandon, Syriana, and Gold previously; screenwriter on Rules of Engagement, Traffic, Abandon, The Alamo, Havoc, Syriana.

                            The project was announced in March 2017 with Downey set to star, and the rest of the cast joined over the following year. Filming began in March 2018 and lasted through June, taking place around the United Kingdom. The film underwent three weeks of reshoots in the spring of 2019, under the supervision of Jonathan Liebesman and Chris McKay after initial test screenings yielded poor results.
                            Universal Pictures theatrically released Dolittle in the United States on January 17, 2020. The film grossed $243 million worldwide and, as of July 2020, is the third highest-grossing film of 2020, but was a box office bomb, losing Universal as much as $100 million. It also received generally negative reviews from critics, mainly due to the stale humor, pacing, and incoherent story.
